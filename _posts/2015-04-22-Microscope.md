As the colonies grew, the need for some sort of optical instrument to observe them closely was evidenced. Reasonably, the next step was to build a microscope.

To do so, the wonders of <a href:"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radius_of_curvature_%28optics%29"target=blank"> ROC </a> were explored.

By inverting the lens of a 3$USD webcam and assembling a structure to control proximity, a cheap digital microscope was created. A zip folder with the laser cut files can be downloaded <a href:"http://biohackacademy.github.io/biofactory/class/2/Webcam-Microscope-SVGs.zip"target=blank>here</a>.

The USB connection allows the images to be recorded through a computer. Adding LEDs to the circuit may be helpful in the production of better images, since light plays an important role in close-up resolution. 

Now it's time to test the device with some pictures. These are growing pubic hairs from a random girl I meet through <a href="http://www.gotinder.com/"target="_blank">Tinderâ„¢</a>:

I am not sure what this is:

But her hair was surely lovely.
